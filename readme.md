# Laravel & Backbone Boilerplate

I don't like setting up projects. Composer, NPM, Bower and Vagrant have made it pretty easy, but still, it's an ache.

This lil' script just ties everything together for you so you can be on your way with a pretty decent Laravel & Backbone Marinoette starting point.

## Installation

```
$ chmod +x install.sh

$ ./install.sh

$ # Make a coffee.
 
$ # Relevant: https://github.com/aaronlord/vagrant
$ vagrant up

$ # Make more coffee.

$ vagrant ssh

$ cd /var/www && grunt release

$ # Head to http://192.168.33.101/ or http://vagrant.local/ 
```
